#+TITLE: Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Richard Sent
#+PROPERTY: header-args :results silent :tangle yes :mkdirp yes

This is a comprehensive configuration file for my system. 

* TODO adjust format for how sway is configured

i.e. have signal number (10) for volume logically grouped together
instead of disparate.

* Warning!

When using noweb, be /very/ careful to be consistent with function
names. If I make a mistake (i.e. using ~src/~ for the name and ~src-~
in the call), ~my/tangle-init~ will fail silently for the rest of the session.

* Base

I also have a =daemon.sh= file that creates any necessary background
daemons.

#+begin_src shell :tangle ~/daemon.sh :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash
#+end_src

** Logging

=setup.sh= and any daemons I create should log to this file. Note that
this returns ~" "~ around  the object if you use noweb. As such, I use
~${HOME}/~ instead of ~~/~ as =bash= will complain otherwise if you
try to use it during redirection.

  ### Variables
  #
  # Logo key. Use Mod1 for Alt.
  set $mod Mod4
  # Home row direction keys, like vim
  set $left h
  set $down j
  set $up k
  set $right l
  # Your preferred terminal emulator
  set $term alacritty
  # Your preferred application launcher
  # Note: pass the final command to swaymsg so that the resulting window can be opened
  # on the original workspace that the command was run on.

* Emacs

** Installation

I'll write this up later.

** Configuration

*** Meta

Much of this section was +stolen+ borrowed from [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs][larstvei]].

All changes to the configuration should be done in =init.org=, *not* in
=init.el=. Any changes in the =init.el= will be overwritten by saving
=init.org=. The =init.el= in this repo should not be tracked by git, and
is replaced the first time Emacs is started (assuming it has been renamed
to =~/.emacs.d=).

Emacs can't load =.org=-files directly, but =org-mode= provides functions
to extract the code blocks and write them to a file. There are multiple
ways of handling this; like suggested by [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3143/can-i-use-org-mode-to-structure-my-emacs-or-other-el-configuration-file][this StackOverflow post]], one
could just use =org-babel-load-file=, but I had problems with
byte-compilation. Previously I tracked both the =org.=- and =el.=-files,
but the git commits got a little messy. So here is a new approach.

When this configuration is loaded for the first time, the =init.el= is
the file that is loaded. It looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ;; This file replaces itself with the actual configuration at first run.

  ;; We can't tangle without org!
  (require 'org)
  ;; Open the configuration
  (find-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org"))
  ;; tangle it
  (org-babel-tangle)
  ;; load it
  (load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))
  ;; finally byte-compile it
  (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))
#+END_SRC

It tangles the org-file, so that this file is overwritten with the actual
configuration.

There is no reason to track the =init.el= that is generated; by running
the following command =git= will not bother tracking it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
  git update-index --assume-unchanged init.el
#+END_SRC

If one wishes to make changes to the repo-version of =init.el= start
tracking again with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged init.el
#+END_SRC

**** Lexical Scoping

I want lexical scoping for the init-file, which can be specified in the
header. The first line of the configuration is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
#+END_SRC

**** Auto-tangle Hook

The =init.el= should (after the first run) mirror the source blocks in
the =init.org=. We can use =C-c C-v t= to run =org-babel-tangle=, which
extracts the code blocks from the current file into a source-specific
file (in this case a =.el=-file).

To avoid doing this each time a change is made we can add a function to
the =after-save-hook= ensuring to always tangle and byte-compile the
=org=-document after changes.

I use =Org Crypt=, which has a feature where it will encrypt your
=org= file when you save. This breaks tangling. I had to modify this
function to tangle everything first, then encrypt before saving.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (defun my/tangle-init ()
    "If the current buffer is 'init.org' the code-blocks are
  tangled, and the tangled file is compiled."
    ;; org-babel-tangle runs save-buffer as a hook. Somewhere along the
    ;; line the current buffer goes back to init.org, leading to an
    ;; infinite loop when using before-save-hook. Now we create a
    ;; tempory buffer with unsaved contents, tangle this buffer, and
    ;; then save, so unencrypted content is tangled and re-encrypted
    ;; before saving.

    (when (equal (buffer-file-name) (expand-file-name "~/config.org"))
      ;; Avoid running hooks when tangling.
      (let ((prog-mode-hook nil) (before-save-hook nil))
	(org-decrypt-entries)
	(org-babel-tangle)
	(org-encrypt-entries))
      (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))))

  (add-hook
   'org-mode-hook
   (lambda () (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'my/tangle-init nil t)))
#+end_src

*** Basics

**** Bootstraps

***** Guix

Installs =Guix= at the system level. They provide a script to help
with installation across multiple architectures that I download and
run.

~sudo~ is broke and won't consistently read properly from stdin with
-S. See https://serverfault.com/questions/477968. After struggling for
a long time (check the subheading for how far my plight went), I
decided to create a Comint process.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ;; Don't install if already present
  (let ((guix-present (condition-case nil
			  (start-process "guix-test" nil "guix" "--version")
			(error nil))))
    (unless guix-present
      (let ((guix-script

		  'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
	       ;; Remove HTTP headers

	       (goto-char (point-min))
	       (re-search-forward "^$")
	       (delete-region (point) (point-min))
	       (buffer-string))))
	;; root permissions required

	  (make-comint-in-buffer name nil "sudo" nil "sh" guix-script-file)
	  (display-buffer (process-buffer (get-process name))
			  '(display-buffer-pop-up-window . '(('window-height . 1.0)
							     ('window-width . 0.5)))

****** COMMENT Emacs-server + sudo entry

There's a neat trick I found with entering passwords within Emacs, but
it requires using Emacs server. I should modify this to start from
somewhere else.

https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/kvvrmx/can_sudo_askpass_use_emacs/gj1l989/

#+begin_src bash :tangle 
#+end_src

***** Straight

I use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management. This is boostrap code from
the Github repo to set up straight.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (setq straight-repository-branch "develop") ; prebuild support for mu4e
  (defvar straight-fix-flycheck t)
  (defvar bootstrap-version)
  (let ((bootstrap-file
	 (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
	(bootstrap-version 5))
    (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
      (with-current-buffer
	  (url-retrieve-synchronously
	   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
	   'silent 'inhibit-cookies)

    (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)         ; Install use-package
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)    ; I don't want to type :straight t a billion times
#+end_src

***** Bind-keys

I'm not entirely sure why this is necessary, and more importantly,
what better solutions there are. But when byte-compiling Emacs,
bind-keys isn't properly loaded by use-package. This means any
custom (and most built-in) keybindings are nonfunctional.

Solution found [[https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/c6fvvr/unable_to_initialize_package_with_usepackage/es92xjd/][here]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package bind-key)
#+end_src

**** exec-path-from-shell

I don't want to worry about stuff breaking because of environment
variable weirdness.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :demand t
    :config
    (when (memq window-system '(mac ns x))
      (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)))
#+end_src

**** no-littering

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package no-littering
    :demand t
    :config
    (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
	  `((".*" ,(no-littering-expand-var-file-name "auto-save/") t))))
#+end_src

**** Speedup

We want to keep the garbage collector from running while we initialize
everything. We can reset it later to a more reasonable value. If we
didn't do this, Emacs would hang when running the garbage collector.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

Replace the file-name-handler-alist to nil, as regexing is cpu
intensive. We need to keep the original value to restore it later. I
don't know all the details behind it, but it sounds helpful!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

And now we revert the changes with a startup hook. ~16777216~ is the
value Doom uses.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

Garbage-collect on focus-out. Emacs /should/ feel snappier overall.

Apparently this can result in a significant speedup when using fonts
larger or smaller than the system default.

***** Results

****** Early Init

As of [2021-02-18 Thu], tangling everything to early-init.el saved 0.06 seconds.

**** Sensible Defaults

I don't need no fancy user interface! These ones are only active when
in a window. Apparently putting this in ~early-init.el~ will speed up
startup even more.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

***** Compilation

When byte compiling, Emacs will go crazy about references to free
variables. Often these are just ~(use-package)~ macros. Not all packages
behave like this, but enough do that I'm putting this in to hope it
will help.

For context the error looks like

#+begin_quote
init.el:77:14: Warning: reference to free variable ‘bind-key’
#+end_quote

where ~bind-key~ can be the name of many different (but not all)
packages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ;; This has no effect. (Actually, it removed the all-the-icons
  ;;  warning, but caused another)
  ; (eval-when-compile (straight-use-package 'use-package))
#+end_src

To hide (but not disable) compilation warnings with native-comp, I'll
change ~warning-suppress-types~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (setq warning-suppress-types '((comp)))
#+end_src

***** Disabled Commands

While I could use ~(setq disabled-command-function nil)~, I'd prefer to
disable them piecemeal in the off-chance there's a disabled command I
actually want to be disabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (put 'downcase-region 'disabled nil)           ; Is it really that confusing?
  (put 'erase-buffer 'disabled nil)              ; It's literally in the name
  (put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)             ; I reiterate. Is it really that confusing?
#+end_src


**** COMMENT ~custom.el~ Support

I disabled this on [2021-11-12 Fri], see [[*Encrypted][Encrypted]].

I have no desire for appending autogenerated elisp to =init.el=. I'd
much rather concentrate that into a single file that I call
=custom.el=. If one doesn't already exist, I want to create a blank
one.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
   (write-region "" "" (expand-file-name "custom.el" (file-name-directory (or load-file-name buffer-file-name))) t)

*** Functions

Custom functions from various sources.

**** Org Heading Fontification

Code and explanations from [[https://reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cw0499/prevent_folded_headings_from_bleeding_out/][/u/ouroboroslisp]] ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20190925072833/https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cw0499/prevent_folded_headings_from_bleeding_out/][archive)]] to try and fix
font lock face bleeding out into org headings if there's only one
space. This is most common with source code blocks, although it's not
visible to everyone as some themes may have the same face for source
code blocks and the background.

I've disabled these functions for now since they didn't appear to help
at all with this init.org file. Instead, I found
=org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line= and set that to nil.

Unfontify the last line of a subtree if it's the end of a source
block. This is the line responsible for the bleeding.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ;; (defun dwim-unfontify-last-line-of-subtree (&rest _)
  ;;   "Unfontify last line of subtree if it's a source block."
  ;;   (save-excursion
  ;;     (org-end-of-subtree)
  ;;     (beginning-of-line)
  ;;     (when (looking-at-p (rx "#+end_src"))
  ;;       (font-lock-unfontify-region
  ;;        (line-end-position) (1+ (line-end-position))))))

  ;; (advice-add #'outline-hide-subtree :after #'dwim-unfontify-last-line-of-subtree)
#+end_src

Now we need to refontify that line at the right time. There’s two
things we need to account for. We need to make sure that the
=#+end_src= line is fontified when it’s visible. Also we should keep
in mind that any newly revealed (ie. By unfolding subtree with
outline-toggle-children) folded source block headings are also
bleeders and need to have their =#+end_src= unfontified also.

It’s also important which functions we choose to advice or modify for
this because we want to minimize the amount of work we want to do.
Ideally, we’d like a pretty core function so that this behavior would
propagate to other functions.

Looking at the source for =outline-toggle-children=, I thought
=outline-show-heading= was a good choice to advise. Keeping all this in
mind I wrote this advising function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ;; (defun dwim-fontify-last-line-of-block (&rest _)
  ;;   "Do what I mean: fontify last line of source block.
  ;;  When the heading has a source block as the last item (in the subtree) do the
  ;;    following:
  ;;  If the source block is now visible, fontify the end its last line.
  ;;  If it’s still invisible, unfontify its last line."
  ;;   (let (font-lock-fn point)
  ;;     (save-excursion
  ;;       (org-end-of-subtree)
  ;;       (beginning-of-line)
  ;;       (run-hooks 'outline-view-change-hook)
  ;;       (when (looking-at-p (rx "#+end_src"))
  ;; 	(setq font-lock-fn
  ;; 	      (if (invisible-p (line-end-position))
  ;; 		  #'font-lock-unfontify-region
  ;; 		#'font-lock-fontify-region))
  ;; 	(funcall font-lock-fn
  ;; 		 (line-end-position)
  ;; 		 (1+ (line-end-position)))))))

*** Navigation

**** Ivy

| =ivy=                    | https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper                    |
| =counsel=                | https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper                    |
| =swiper=                 | https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper                    |

Let's start with the backbone of it all. =Ivy= provides a
completion engine that =counsel= and =swiper= build off of. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package ivy
    :diminish
    :hook (after-init . ivy-mode)
    :config
    (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t       ; Recent files and bookmarks in ivy-switch-buffer
	  ivy-count-format "%d/%d "
	  ivy-wrap t))                    ; Wrap around with next-line and previous-line
#+end_src

=counsel= provides many custom functions designed to take advantage of
=ivy=, such as =counsel-find-file=.

FIXME: I'd prefer to find a way to load =counsel= without needing to
use ~:demand t~. I tried ~ivy-mode-hook~ but that caused issues with =prescient=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package counsel

	   :map ivy-minibuffer-map
	   ("M-y" . ivy-next-line))
    :config (counsel-mode))
#+end_src

=swiper= is an =isearch= alternative, which is good because I don't
like =isearch=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

CLOSED: [2021-11-16 Tue 18:52]

~all-the-icons-ivy-rich-doc-face~ controls them (possibly indirectly
with inheritance).

I took the same approach as with ~linum~.

***** Counsel-Tramp

| =counsel-tramp= | https://github.com/masasam/emacs-counsel-tramp |

Provides a interface for using =counsel= completion with SSH. Entries
are populated from ~/.ssh/config~. Connections can also be added using
~counsel-tramp-custom-connections~.

Support for =docker= and =vagrant= is also provided if you are using
=docker-tramp= or =vagrant-tramp=.

| =ivy-prescient=     | https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el |
| =company-prescient= | https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el |

=prescient= provide a new completion library for =ivy=, =counsel=, and

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package prescient
    :after ivy

**** Window Management

| =ace-window= | https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window |

Running ~other-window~ a billion times isn't exactly enjoyable. What
is enjoyable is executing ~ace-window~ once and typing 1-2 keys to
select a window.

Instead of 0-9, =ace-window= will use the home row keys to select a
window.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package ace-window
    :defines aw-keys
    :commands ace-window

**** Comments

| =comment-dwim-2= | https://github.com/remyferre/comment-dwim-2 |

I don't enjoy how ~comment-dwim~ and ~comment-line~ are two different
keys for very similar functionality. =comment-dwim-2= provides that
and a bit more. Sometimes indentation seems weird in elisp with
comments not lining up.

This is currently bugged with =enh-ruby-mode=. End of line comments
are not inserted, although it can successfully comment and uncomment
an entire line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

    :config
    (defadvice comment-indent (around comment-indent-with-spaces activate) ; Not the cause of enh-ruby-mode issue

    ;; (defun cd2/inline-comment-command () ; this is the function called when you repeat the command
    ;;   ;; do nothing (not killing the end-of-line comment)

**** zzz to char

| =zzz to char= | https://github.com/mrkkrp/zzz-to-char |

Replace ~zap-to-char~ and ~zap-up-to-char~ with ~zzz~ equivalents. I
can select a  specific character, either forward or back, with the
home row. As opposed to the closest character.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

*** Languages

**** Ruby

| =rbenv=    | https://github.com/senny/rbenv.el        |
| =inf-ruby= | https://github.com/nonsequitur/inf-ruby/ |
| =robe=     | https://github.com/dgutov/robe           |

=rbenv= for Emacs is 7 years old and unmainted. I'd like to replace it
sooner rather than later.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package rbenv
    :diminish
    :hook (ruby-mode . global-rbenv-mode))
#+end_src

=inf-ruby= is something I don't know how to use well yet. If you use
=irb= in =shell=, you will want the line =IRB.conf[:USE_MULTILINE] =
false= in =~/.config/irb/irbrc=, as otherwise you will just get
downward pointing arrows and no input or output.
Tested \approx 4/2020, didn't observe 11/2020 but may still be present.

[[https://github.com/nonsequitur/inf-ruby/issues/133][Here]] is a trick for guarding the IRB.conf clause so it won't impact
IRB sessions outside of Emacs. (Not tested thoroughly!)


#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package inf-ruby ; Latest version has --nomultline by default, but not for bundle console, only ruby
    :hook (ruby-mode . inf-ruby-minor-mode))

=solargraph=. Having to run a full-blown interpreter seems overkill
and prone to errors.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el

#+end_src

**** Assembly

#+begin_quote
AsmMode is a simple assembly programming mode that comes with Emacs.
It is based on TextMode. See AssemblyProgramming for alternatives.

AsmMode has some strange (relative to other Emacs modes) defaults for
indentation (as of Emacs 24.5): It sets ‘tab-always-indent’ to ‘nil’
so that hitting ‘TAB’ will each time insert a tab stop, pushing the
code farther to the right. Therefore I suggest using the following
config which resets ‘tab-always-indent’ back to the default:
#+end_quote

~asm-comment-char~ seems to have been deprecated, so I removed it.

[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AsmMode]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (defun my-asm-mode-hook ()
    ;; asm-mode sets it locally to nil, to "stay closer to the old TAB behaviour".

#+end_src

*** Org

**** Main

| =org= | https://orgmode.org/ |

I use a more up-to-date version of Org than what Emacs ships with.
Currently ~org-adapt-identation~ does not work with ~'headline-data~.
(At least, I haven't gotten it work successfully.) Tested 11/2020.

Additionally, I want org to support as many languages as possible
without needing to add them all to ~org-babel-load-languages~.

I added a function from [[https:emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3387][StackExchange]] to update \( \LaTeX \) symbols
as I zoom in. For time sake, the code that toggles the preview was
removed, as Emacs takes quite a while to regenerate the images. When
rapidly zooming (e.g. C-mouse-4), Emacs could even halt entirely. I do
let it remove existing previews so I don't have a mix of small and big
previews.

I'm currently trying to write advice for ~org-export-dispatch~ to add
the org-latex-logfile-extensions when initially exporting the file.

***** gnuplot

| =gnuplot=       | https://github.com/emacsorphanage/gnuplot         |

While not quite a picture, graphs are also nice to have. This allows
for gnuplot src blocks in org mode. The =gnuplot= emacs package might also be
required, although I think it comes built in with recent versions of
=org=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
    (use-package gnuplot)
#+end_src

***** Org Crypt

Confusingly, =Org Crypt= *must* be loaded before =org=.
~org-crypt-use-before-save-magic~ creates an org-mode hook that
creates a before-save hook to encrypt the file. When loading is
deferred, the org hooks will execute before this hook is added,
meaning headings will not encrypt on save.

I wasn't able to solve this issue, so I just removed the autoload that
~:bind~ adds with ~:demand~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package org-crypt
    :straight nil
    :demand t
    :bind ("C-c d" . org-decrypt-entries)
    :config
    (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
    (setq org-crypt-key "1982679C"        ; Change to your key
	  epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback
	  org-crypt-disable-auto-save t
	  org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance '("crypt")))

***** mixed-pitch

| =mixed-pitch= | https://gitlab.com/jabranham/mixed-pitch |

#+begin_quote
Mixed pitch is a minor mode that enables mixing fixed-pitch (also known as
fixed-width or monospace) and variable-pitch (AKA “proportional”) fonts. It
tries to be smart about which fonts get which face. Fonts that look like code,
org-tables, and such remain fixed-pitch and everything else becomes
variable-pitch. The variable ~mixed-pitch-fixed-pitch-faces~ is a list of faces
that will remain fixed-pitch in ~mixed-pitch-mode~.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package mixed-pitch
    :hook (org-mode . mixed-pitch-mode))
#+end_src

***** ox-hugo

| =ox-hugo= | https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/ |

#+begin_quote
ox-hugo is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible
Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or
YAML format).
#+end_quote

In other words, this is great for blogging. It supports multiple posts
per =org= file, separated by top level headings. I suspect this'll be
my preferred way to edit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
(use-package ox-hugo
  :after ox)

*** Utilities

This is meant for utility packages that don't assist with editing,
navigation, or similar, but still provide a benefit.

**** 0xc

| =0xc= |  https://github.com/AdamNiederer/0xc |

A package that provides easy base conversions inside of Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package 0xc
    :commands (0xc-convert 0xc-convert-point 0xc-live-convert))
#+end_src

**** Esup

| =Esup= | https://github.com/jschaf/esup |

Profile Emacs startup times with =M-x esup=. There's an apparent issue
with some combination of =straight=, =esup= and byte-compiling that
causes =Esup= to fail to run, either showing =Symbolic link to Git...=
or another error message. [[https://github.com/jschaf/esup/issues/54#issuecomment-651247749][This]] contains a fix.

It seems the fix isn't perfect, Esup is largely underestimating my
startup time. When I look in the breakdown, large sections of the code
are unaccounted for.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  (use-package esup
    :commands esup
    :config (setq esup-depth 0))
#+end_src

**** PDF Tools

| =PDF Tools= | https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools |

#+begin_quote
PDF Tools is, among other things, a replacement of DocView for PDF
files. The key difference is that pages are not pre-rendered by e.g.
ghostscript and stored in the file-system, but rather created
on-demand and stored in memory.

[…]

Actually, displaying PDF files is
just one part of PDF Tools. Since poppler can provide us with all
kinds of information about a document and is also able to modify it,
there is a lot more we can do with it.
#+end_quote

This package requires a Unix-based OS.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
(unless sys/win32p
  (use-package pdf-tools
    :mode ("\\.pdf\\'" . pdf-tools-install)))
#+end_src

**** Restart Emacs

| =restart-emacs= | https://github.com/iqbalansari/restart-emacs |

A small package to restart Emacs within Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
      (use-package restart-emacs
        :commands restart-emacs
        :config (setq restart-emacs-restore-frames t))
#+end_src

**** Unbound

| =unbound= | https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/unbound.el |

Find unbound keys with ~describe-unbound-keys~ and enter a number
representing complexity.

FIXME: Fixed most errors except an ~Unused lexical variable 'i'~ in
~defun key-complexity~. The variable is definitely used; I'm not sure
what the issue is.

  ;; complexity to allow, which should probably be at least 5 to find enough

Don't want to do that.
https://jonathanabennett.github.io/blog/2019/05/28/emacs.org-~-may-2019/
might have a solution with tangling.
*** DONE Do we need straight in init.el?
CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 11:02]
Any drawbacks from loading with old org version then upgrading?
*** DONE Can we move speedup into =early-init.el=?
CLOSED: [2021-02-23 Tue 22:44]
[[https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/dppmqj/do_i_even_need_to_leverage_earlyinitel_if_i_have/][This]] talks about how disabling certain decorations in early init is
faster. I'm curious how I can get org-tangle to export some code
blocks in one file and other code blocks in another file.

If I do this, I should set package-enable-at-startup to nil as well.

And loading org in early init wouldn't be a bad idea either.
*** TODO Compatibility with tty
It had previous failed to load in a tty, complaining about listp nil.
I'm not reproducing the error now, just keep an eye out?
*** TODO Better loading on gnuplot and fix two attempts to execute src blocks.
I would like to have it delay until either opening a gnuplot file or when
executing gnuplot source blocks. Additionally it fails to execute src
blocks on the first attempt when launching emacs, requiring two
attempts.

Failing to execute gnuplot on the first attempt doesn't seem to just
be limited to gnuplot, but C as well. Probably an issue with my babel advice.
*** TODO Restore autosave transform
Currently files fail to save and a warning periodically appears with
it enabled.
*** TODO ltximg folder no littering

*** TODO Add float package to ~org-latex-packages-alist~
